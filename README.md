## ALFT: M5L3 - Warm-up '24

You're building an application for a music shop. They want a feature that recommends an song based on their current mood.

1. Create a variable named mood.
2. Assign it a string value of "happy".
3. Create a variable named recommendedSong. Do not assign a value.
4. Implement the recommendation logic.
   - If the mood is equal to "happy", recommend "Here Comes the Sun by The Beatles".
   - If the mood is equal to "sad", recommend "Someone Like You by Adele".
   - Anything else, recommend "Break My Soul by Beyonce".
5. Console log the recommended song.
